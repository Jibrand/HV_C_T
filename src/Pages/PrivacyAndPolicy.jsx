    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    e. Information Collected from Other Sources
    <br />
    <br />
    We may also collect information about you from other sources, including from
    our third-party partners or service providers, publicly available sources or
    social networking sites.
    <br />
    <br />
    We may combine this information with other information in our possession,
    which helps us to update, enhance, and analyze our Services, and provide
    tailored experiences for you.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    f. Social Plug-ins
    <br />
    <br />
    Social plug-ins (“plug-ins”) of social networks are used on our websites, in
    particular the “Share” or “Share with friends” button of Facebook, whose
    website: facebook.com is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave,
    Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. Facebook Ireland Limited, Hanover Reach, 5-7
    Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, is responsible for Facebook.com in Europe.
    The plug-ins are usually marked with a Facebook logo.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    Besides Facebook, we use plug-ins from “Twitter” (Provider: Twitter, Inc.,
    1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103), “LinkedIn” (Provider:
    LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043,
    USA).
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    For data protection reasons, we have deliberately decided against utilizing
    direct plug-ins of social networks on our websites. For this reason, there
    is no automatic data transmission to social networks such as Facebook,
    Twitter, LinkedIn once you access our website.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    Data will be transmitted to social networks only if you actively click on
    the respective social network button. In this case, your web browser starts
    a connection to the respective social network’s servers. By clicking on the
    respective button (e.g., “Pass on”, “Share” or “Share with friends”) you
    agree that your browser will produce a link to the respective social
    network’s servers and transmit usage data to the respective operator of the
    social network and vice versa. We have no influence upon the nature and
    extent of the data that is then gathered by the social networks.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    The social network providers store the data collected about you as user
    profiles for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or
    demand-oriented design of its website. Such an evaluation takes place in
    particular (also for not logged in users) for the representation of
    demand-fair advertisement and in order to inform other users of the social
    network about your activities on our website. You have a right of objection
    to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the
    respective plug-in providers to exercise this right. Through the plug-ins we
    offer you the possibility to interact with social networks and other users,
    so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a
    user.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    The data is transferred regardless of whether you have an account with the
    plug-in providers and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the
    plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to
    your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you click the activated
    button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores
    this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your
    contacts. We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social
    network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid
    being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its
    processing by the plug-in provider, please refer to the data protection
    declarations of these providers as notified below. They will also provide
    you with further information about your rights in this regard and setting
    options to protect your privacy.

    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    g. YouTube Videos
    <br />
    <br />
    We have integrated YouTube videos into our website along with other video
    technology, which are stored on http://www.YouTube.com and other websites
    including https://hackerverse.tv, and can be played directly from our
    website. These are all integrated in the “extended data protection mode”,
    i.e., no data about you as a user will be transmitted to YouTube, if you do
    not click on the videos to start playing them. Only when you play the videos
    the data referred to in the next paragraph will be transferred to YouTube.
    We have no influence on this data transfer.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    By visiting the website, YouTube receives the information that you have
    accessed the corresponding subpage of our Website. In addition, the data
    specified in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. This is
    independent of whether YouTube provides a user account through which you are
    logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google,
    your information will be directly associated with your account. If you do
    not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out
    before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as user profiles and
    uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or
    demand-oriented design of its website. Such evaluation takes place in
    particular (even for unlogged-in users) to provide demand-oriented
    advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your
    activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of
    these user profiles, whereby you must contact YouTube to exercise this
    right.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and
    processing by YouTube, please refer to the privacy policy.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    In an aggregated form or otherwise in a form that cannot reasonably be used
    to identify you.
    <br />
    <br />
    In some cases, we may enable you to access third-party products or services
    through our Services. Please note that those products or services are
    offered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by us, and
    we are not responsible for their actions, their terms, their use of
    information, or their products or services.
    <br />

    7.5 Other Rights

    In some cases, particularly if you are a resident of the EEA, the United

    We may retain personal information where required by law or where we have an
    ongoing legitimate business need to do so. For example, we may retain such
    information to provide you a service you have requested, to comply with
    applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, or where necessary for
    fraud prevention, dispute resolution, enforcement of our contracts and
    terms, or for safety reasons. In addition, we may retain your information
    from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees
    owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
    investigation, enforce our Terms of Service and take other actions permitted
    by law.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    9. Security
    <br />
    <br />
    We follow generally accepted industry standards and maintain reasonable
    safeguards designed to secure the information in our possession, and only
    those at Nebulonium with a legitimate business need to access your personal
    information are permitted to do so. We also take reasonable steps to ensure
    that third parties to whom we transfer information will provide protections
    appropriate to that type of information. If you have reason to believe that
    your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately contact us.
    <br />
    <br />
    10. Use by Minors
    <br />
    <br />
    We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from or about, or
    direct or target interest-based advertising to, anyone under the age of 13
    (or under the age of 16 for those in the EEA, United Kingdom, or
    Switzerland), nor do we knowingly allow such individuals to use our
    Services. If you believe we might have any personal information from or
    about a child under this age, please contact us using the details provided
    on the last page. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered such
    information, we will delete it.
    <br />
    <br />
    11. Additional Information for Residents of the EEA, United Kingdom, and
    Switzerland
    <br />
    11.1 Rights and Choices Available to EEA Residents
    <br />
    <br />
    If you are a resident of a member country of the European Economic Area
    (“EEA”), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you may have the following
    rights with respect to any information about you that constitutes “personal
    data” under EEA law:
    <br />
    <br />
    11.2 Access your personal data:
    <br />
    <br />
    You may have the right to obtain confirmation regarding whether we process
    your personal data and obtain a copy of the personal data we have collected
    about you. (Note that this right only applies to personal information
    relating to you, and not to any other user.)
    <br />
    <br />
    11.3 Rectify or correct your personal data:
    <br />
    <br />
    You may have the right to correct your personal data where it contains
    inaccuracies.
    <br />
    <br />
    11.4 Request erasure (deletion) of your personal data:
    <br />
    <br />
    You may have the right to request that we delete your personal data in
    certain cases, for example when it is no longer necessary to fulfill the
    purposes for which Nebulonium collected it. This right may be limited to the
    extent that Nebulonium is permitted or required by applicable law to retain
    the data. (Note that if you request deletion of your personal data, you may
    no longer be able to use or access the Services. If you share devices with
    someone else who uses the Services, that person may no longer access and use
    your account information. If you decide to use or access the Services again,
    we may consider this a new Account and may collect personal data associated
    with that Account in accordance with this Privacy Policy).
    <br />
    <br />
    11.5 Restrict or object to the processing of your personal data:
    <br />
    <br />
    In certain cases, you may have the right to object to our processing of your
    personal data, or request that we restrict that processing. Because the data
    that we collect is generally required to provide the Services to you, if you
    object to the processing of your personal data, this may have the same
    effect as requesting deletion of this data. This right may be limited to the
    extent that Nebulonium is permitted or required by applicable law to
    continue processing the data. (Note that if you object to the processing of
    your personal data, you and others who use your devices to access the
    Services may no longer be able to use or access the Services).
    <br />
    <br />
    11.6 Request a portable copy of your personal data:
    <br />
    <br />
    In certain limited cases, you may be able to request that we provide you
    with a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and
    machine-readable format so that you can transmit it elsewhere.
    <br />
    <br />
    To protect the privacy of your information, Nebulonium verifies your
    identity and processes all rights requests. If you wish to exercise any of
    the rights described above, please send us an email via:
    privacy@nebulonium.com.
    <br />
    <br />
    In addition to the rights described above, if we have collected and
    processed certain types of personal data with your consent, you may withdraw
    that consent in the manner described when you provided consent. Withdrawing
    your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted
    prior to then, nor will it affect any processing based on lawful grounds
    other than consent.
    <br />
    <br />
    In some cases, you may have the right to file a complaint with a data
    protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data. For
    more information, contact your local data protection authority. We will
    cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities to resolve any
    privacy-related complaints that cannot be amicably resolved between you and
    us.
    <br />
    <br />
    11.7 Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
    <br />
    <br />
    If you are from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, our legal basis
    for collecting and using your personal data will depend on the type of
    information and the context in which we collect it. In general, we collect
    personal data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we
    need it to perform a contract with you, or where it is in our legitimate
    interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or
    fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal
    obligation to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need it to
    protect your vital interests or those of another person. If you have
    questions about the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal
    data, please contact us.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    11.8 Transfer of Personal Data from the EEA
    <br />
    <br />
    Nebulonium may transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland
    to the United States, including personal information we receive from
    individuals residing in the EEA, the UK or Switzerland who visit our Website
    and/or who may use of our Services or otherwise interact with us. Please
    note that for individuals located in the EEA or the UK, the term Personal
    Information used in this notice is equivalent to the term “personal data”
    under applicable European and UK data protection laws. When we engage in
    such transfers of personal information, it relies on i) Adequacy Decisions
    as adopted by European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation
    (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), or ii) Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the
    European Commission.
    <br />
    <br />
    The European Commission has determined that the Standard Contractual Clauses
    provide sufficient safeguards to protect the personal data transferred
    outside the EU or EEA. For more information, please visit
    https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en.
    We also continually monitors the circumstances surrounding such transfers in
    order to ensure that these maintain, in practice, a level of protection that
    is essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed by the GDPR.
    <br />
    <br /> <br />
    <br />
    12. International Transfer
    <br />
    <br />
    These Services are hosted in the United States of America and subject to
    applicable U.S. Federal and state laws, rules and regulations. Your personal
    data, may be transferred to, stored at and processed by us and our
    affiliates and other third parties outside the country in which you reside,
    including, but not limited to the United States, where data protection and
    privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in your
    country. By using our Services, you consent and agree to this transfer,
    storing, processing and use of your personal data in accordance with this
    Privacy Policy.
    <br />
    <br />

    over how your personal information is collected and shared.

    agreements, and resolve disputes.
